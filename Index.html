    <h1 id="Footer"> Journey With Code Crew SO Far!</h1>
    <p>
        <h3>
            Within the last week, I've learned a lot, but I'm still confused on a few things. A few of the things I grasped quickly will be lsted below:
        </h3>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Mathmatic and Numrical formulas for mathmatical operations within a code.
        </li>
        <button onclick="operations()">Operations</button>

      <script>
      function operations() {
        alert("Basically PEMDAS");
      }
      </script>
        <li>
            I've learned about how loops work and how to make some conditioned.
        </li>
        <button onclick="requirments()">Basic Loops</button>

      <script>
      function requirments() {
        alert("Requirment Loops");
      }
      </script>
        <li>
            I have a solid understanding of the difference between For Loops, Else If Loops and While Loops.
        </li>
        <button onclick="conditions()">Different Loops</button>

      <script>
      function conditions() {
        alert("More conditioning Loops");
      }
      </script>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <h3>
            On The other hand, there are a few things I don't understand about last weeks topic. Take a look at the list below:
        </h3>
    
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Try...and Catch. I just don't understand how it trys to run an error, if it already knows it's an error. i also don't undertsnad its use.
        </li>
        <button onclick=" TryCatch()">Weird Stuff</button>

      <script>
      function TryCatch() {
        alert("TRY to understand what this is used for");
      }
      </script>
        <li>
            "Finally" statements. Again, another keyword dealing with erros. I don't uderstand how it can still run code if there are errors within it. I know you ca skip over errors to run the following code, but then what's the point of this keyword if they work the same?
        </li>
        <button onclick="Finally()">Finally</button>

      <script>
      function Finally() {
        alert("FINALLY, can't do this anymore");
      }
      </script>
    </ul>


      <button onclick="myFunction()">Don't Do It</button>

      <script>
      function myFunction() {
        alert("IF THEY SET THOSE ANDROIDS FREE IT'LL BE THE END OF US ALL!! NOOOOOOO!!");
      }
      </script>
